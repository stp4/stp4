### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a research assistant at the UniversitÃ¤tsklinik Innsbruck and have been a freelance statistician since 2006.

This Github page is a pure playground for me and the libraries presented are purely experimental.

If someone (hello Viki :wink:) does not want to be prevented from installing the libraries, then please do so in this order. 


-    Iinstall the latest version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/stp4) as follow:
  
``` r
# Install
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stp4/stp25settings")
devtools::install_github("stp4/stp25output2")
devtools::install_github("stp4/stp25tools")
devtools::install_github("stp4/stp25stat2")
devtools::install_github("stp4/stp25plot")
devtools::install_github("stp4/stp25data")

```
The libraries are optimised for a Windos system and I have only tested them there. On Linux or Mac, the paths in the source code must be adapted.
